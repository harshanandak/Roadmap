## 📋 WHAT ARE POSTPONED FEATURES?

Features that were planned but **strategically deferred** to later phases due to:
- Dependencies on modules not yet built
- Risk of rework when dependencies change
- Better timing after platform stabilizes
- Resource allocation priorities

**Important:** Postponed ≠ Canceled. These features will be implemented when dependencies are ready.

## 🔄 POSTPONED FEATURES POLICY

All postponed features follow the policy defined in [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md#tracking-postponed-features).

**Every postponed feature entry MUST include:**
- ✅ What was postponed (brief summary + link)
- ✅ Postponed date
- ✅ Reason (strategic rationale with dependencies)
- ✅ Dependencies (checkboxes for tracking)
- ✅ Priority (High/Medium/Low)
- ✅ Estimated effort
- ✅ When to implement (specific milestone)
- ✅ Review trigger (when to revisit)
- ✅ Detailed rationale

---

## 📋 HOW TO ADD NEW POSTPONED FEATURES

1. **Create detailed specification file** in this folder: `[FEATURE_NAME].md`
2. **Add entry to** [docs/implementation/postponed-features.md](../implementation/postponed-features.md)
3. **Follow the template** defined in CLAUDE.md
4. **Set review trigger** (when to revisit the decision)
5. **Update CHANGELOG.md** with postponement decision

## 📊 POSTPONEMENT DECISION FRAMEWORK

### 5-Question Framework (Before Implementation)

1. **Data Dependencies:** Does this feature depend on data from other modules?
2. **Integration Points:** Will this integrate with other modules' APIs?
3. **User Experience Flow:** Does this make sense at this point in user journey?
4. **Database Schema Stability:** Does this depend on specific tables/columns?
5. **Testing Feasibility:** Can this be fully tested with currently available data?

**If ANY question reveals blocking dependencies → POSTPONE**

**See:** [CLAUDE.md - Execution Timing](../../CLAUDE.md#execution-timing--dependency-cross-checks)
