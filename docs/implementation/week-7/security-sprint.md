## Dependabot Production Dependencies Fix (2025-12-28)

**What Changed:**
- Fixed Dependabot PR #24 with 27 production dependency updates
- Resolved breaking changes in major version upgrades
- Pinned `@ai-sdk/react` to v2 (v3 requires AI SDK 6 which is BETA)
- Upgraded `react-grid-layout` to v2 using legacy API
- Removed `@types/react-grid-layout` (v2 includes TypeScript types)
- Created missing `automated` GitHub label

**Breaking Changes Resolved:**

| Package | From | To | Fix Applied |
|---------|------|-----|-------------|
| `@ai-sdk/react` | 2.0.104 | 3.0.3 (blocked) | Pinned to v2 |
| `react-grid-layout` | 1.5.2 | 2.1.1 | Use legacy import |
| `@types/react-grid-layout` | 1.3.6 | - | Removed |

**Why:**
- AI SDK v6 is BETA (announced Dec 2025) - not production-ready
- react-grid-layout v2 has legacy compatibility layer
- React 19.2.3 includes security patch (CVE-2025-55182)

**Files Modified:**
- `next-app/package.json` - Pinned versions
- `next-app/src/components/analytics/widgets/dashboard-builder.tsx` - Legacy import
- `next-app/package-lock.json` - Regenerated

**PRs:**
- Closed: #24 (original Dependabot PR)
- Merged: #27 (fix PR with all updates)

---

## Dependencies Created

- [Post-launch] AI SDK v6 migration when stable
- [Post-launch] react-grid-layout v2 native API migration
